## Web scrapping to run a sentiment analysis regarding consumer phone preference


**Project Goal:** We run a sentiment analysis searching for mobile phone preferences by counting words appearing within relevant web documents. Afterwards, we use this data to search for patterns within the documents, before labelling the documents with a value that represents the level of positive or negative sentiment toward each of the selected devices.

**Data characteristics:** Cloud Computing via Amazon Web Services (AWS) is used to conduct the analysis; the analysed data sets are taken from Common Crawl.

**Language used:** Python, AWS

There is also my atempt of doing a web scraper in Python.
